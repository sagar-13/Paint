	Today     :
	Obstacles :

Nov 4, 2016
	Yesterday :
	Today     : Familiarized self with assignment and got started
				on user story 7. 
	Obstacles : Making thickness slider non-universal. 

Nov 5, 2016
	Yesterday : Got a thickness combo box which changed the thickness
				of all shapes on the canvas at once.
	Today     : Implemented a JSlider instead of a JComboBox
				for changing the thickness. Got the thickness
				changer to work properly for circles only.
				Also, fixed Bug2. Button selection is working.
	Obstacles : Lots of git issues today. Multiple users working on the
				same branch by accident caused some issues.

Nov 6, 2016
	Yesterday : Decided to complete UserStory 7 after some merges in the 
				future since it would be easier to implement for the rest 
				of the shapes that way.
	Today     : Organized product backlog a bit. Brain-stormed about
				bug 3 design pattern but ultimately was not able to get
				anything significant done.
	
Nov 7, 2016
	Yesterday :
	Today     : Brainstorming design patterns.
	Obstacles :
	
Nov 8, 2016
	Yesterday :
	Today     : Merged Bug 2 and UserStory7 into master. Implemented thickness
				for all shapes. Attempted implementing command design pattern.
				Result was very buggy. Started from scratch and went for second
				attempt. 
	Obstacles : Broken shape drawing functionality when implementing pattern.
	
Nov 9, 2016
	Yesterday :
	Today     : Implemented a command design pattern and finished Bug03.
				Also, made many improvements to the code. Merged Bug03 into
				the master. Implemented HashMap to remove if blocks in 
				ShapeChooserPanel. A little bit of documentation also done.
	Obstacles : Lots of git issues when merging. Broke
				a lot of functionality in the process which had to be 
				re-implemented in order to work with the new design pattern.
				(Colour, fill, thickness, etc)


Part 2:

Nov 12, 2016
	Yesterday : Read over assignment and tried to figure out what is done already.
	Today     : Starting on Bug 2.4 and 2.3. Converting previous command design 
				pattern to strategy and making Factory for the shape making.
	Obstacles : 
	
Nov 13, 2016
	Yesterday : Finished Bug2.3 and Bug2.4. 
	Today     : Think of ideas for extra functionality. Try implementing 
				transparency and selection copy. Organized product and sprint
				backlog in accordance with the current progress.
	Obstacles :
	
Nov 14, 2016
	Yesterday : Implemented transparency JSlider in UserStory15.
	Today     : Merge to master.
	Obstacles : Many problems occurred because many merges to master 
				happened today. Spent a lot of time fixing broken
				functionality from merging mistakes.
	
Nov 15, 2016
	Yesterday : Merged transparency slider. 
	Today     : Fixed up appearance a bit and added comments.
				Removed unused imports, implemented FillableShape
				to prevent shapes from having attributes they don't 
				use. Fixed up constructors and documentation
				accordingly.
	Obstacles :
	
Nov 16, 2016
	Yesterday : All of the planned stuff was accomplished.
	Today     : Gave thickness it's own panel and moved it to a convenient
				location. Changed the way every class accesses it. Added 
				ToggleButtons instead of disabling selected buttons for 
				shape chooser panel. Made sure scrum documents were organized.
	Obstacles :
